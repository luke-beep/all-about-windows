### **General Tweaks**

---

- Uninstall all unnecessary apps.

- Make sure that you have the latest version of windows. As of current date it would be [**Windows 10**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/release-health/release-information) | [**Windows 11**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/release-health/windows11-release-information).

- Download this application => **[https://github.com/hellzerg/optimizer/releases](https://github.com/hellzerg/optimizer/releases)** and continue following the guide.

<img src="./assets/optimizer.png" alt="Optimizer" title="Optimizer">

> For example, if you would like to keep print service on then wouldn't tick "Disable Print Service".

- Disable all the unnecessary startup apps. To do this you want to go and open up Task Manager. Go to the Startup tab and disable all the apps that you do not use.

- To complete this process you may need to go into regedit and the delete some startup keys from there, or you could use **[https://github.com/hellzerg/optimizer/releases](https://github.com/hellzerg/optimizer/releases)** and simply go to the Startup tab and select all the apps that you do not use and delete them.

- Select the Startup tab.
  <img src="./assets/tab1.png" alt="Optimizer" title="Optimizer">

- Select all the apps that you do not use.

<img src="./assets/tab2.png" alt="Optimizer" title="Optimizer">

- Click delete.

<img src="./assets/tab3.png" alt="Optimizer" title="Optimizer">

- When you recieve the popup to delete all the selected startup items click yes. This deletes all the registry keys for the startup apps that you do not use.

<br>
<img src="./assets/tab4.png" alt="Optimizer" title="Optimizer">
<br>

- Run Windows Disk Cleanup. WIN + R and type `cleanmgr.exe`, then press enter. Choose your drive and press **OK**. Then select what you would like to clean up and hit **OK**.

- Run Windows Defragment and trimmer. WIN + R and type `dfrgui.exe`, then press enter. Select your drive and press Optimize or Analyze.

- Change energy plan. Open control panel and search for power plan. Then select **show additional plans** and select **Ultimate Performance**.

- Run SystemPropertiesAdvanced in WIN + R. Then hit settings for performance. Then select **Adjust for best performance**.

- If you have external drives open up SystemPropertiesAdvanced and go to settings for Performance. Then go to advanced and under virtual memory select **No paging file**. This will disable the paging file on your external drives. **Do not do this on your main drive.**

- Enable everything in System > Monitor > Graphics Settings > Default Graphics Settings. This will make your computer run smoother.

- Disable Storage Sense.

- WIN + R and type `msconfig`. Then go to the Services tab and disable all the services that you do not use. Then go to the Boot tab and open up advanced options for your boot drive. Go back to the Boot tab and change your timeout to 5 seconds for a mid-high end computer. 10 seconds for a low-mid end computer. And 20 seconds for a laptop. **Do not change anything else in there**.

- Open an elevated command prompt and type `bcdedit /set increaseuserva 3072` and press enter. This will increase the amount of virtual memory that your computer can use. This will help with performance and crashes if you have a 32 bit system. **Do not do this on a 64 bit system.**

> Open an elevated command prompt and type `slmgr /ipk W269N-WFGWX-YVC9B-4J6C9-T83GX`. Then set a KMS server by typing `slmgr /skms kms8.msguides.com`. Then activate windows by typing `slmgr /ato`. This will activate windows and make it enable all the features and remove the ugly watermark. Run `slmgr /xpr` to check if it worked.

### **Service Tweaks**

---

**Disclaimers for this section specifically:** Do not, and I repeat do NOT disable any service that you don't know what it does. If you do not know what a service does, then google it. If you disable a service that is required for your computer to run, unexpected errors might popup. I am not responsible for any damage done to your computer. This guide is for educational purposes only.

1. To begin with this section, you have to open up services.msc. To do this you can either WIN + R and type "services.msc" or you can open up task manager and go to the services tab and click on "Open Services" at the bottom of the window. Or by simply searching for services in the start menu.

2. Identify the unnecessary services: Look through the list of services and identify those that you don't need. You can use google to identify services that's unnecessary and that can be safely disabled.

3. Disable unnecessary services, to disable a service, right-click on it and select "Properties". In the "Startup type" drop-down menu, select "Disabled". Click "Apply" and then "OK" to save your changes. Repeat this step for any other unnecessary services.

4. Restart your computer: Once you've made changes to the services, it's a good idea to restart your computer to ensure that the changes take effect instantly.

> Optimizing Windows services can help improve your computer's performance by reducing unnecessary resource usage and delta cycles. However, it's important to be extra careful when disabling services, as some services are required for important things. If you disable a service that's required for your computer to run, unexpected errors might popup. So, make sure to only disable services that you don't need.

### **Safe to use HoneCTRL settings for NVIDIA**

---

> **HoneCTRL** is a software designed for tweaking and optimizing your computer's performance. It allows you to adjust various system settings, such as CPU and RAM usage, power management, and network configurations, to get the most out of your computer's hardware. However, it is important to be cautious when using **HoneCTRL** and similar tweaking software, as making the wrong changes can cause serious problems and even damage your system. It's always a good idea to set a restore point before making any adjustments, so you can easily revert to a stable configuration if something goes wrong.
